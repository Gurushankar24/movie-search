## 🔑 API

This project uses the free [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) for movie data.

> To use your own key, replace the `apiKey` value in `src/app/services/movie-service.ts`.

---

## 🧠 Angular Concepts Showcased

This project was built to practice and demonstrate real-world Angular patterns:

- **Signals** — Reactive state throughout using `signal`, `.set()`, `.update()`
- **Standalone Components** — Full standalone API, no NgModules
- **HTTP Interceptors** — Centralized error handling via `error.interceptor.ts`
- **Angular Animations** — Fade + slide-up on details page, shake + slide-out on card removal
- **CDK Drag & Drop** — Drag distance threshold detection for swipe-to-remove on liked movies
- **Angular Material** — Icons and UI primitives
- **Router with Child Routes** — Nested layout using `Header` as the parent route shell
- **LocalStorage Persistence** — All user data persisted across browser sessions

---

## 📌 Roadmap

- [ ] Add filtering by genre, year, and type (movie/series)
- [ ] Sort liked movies and wishlist items
- [ ] Shareable wishlist links
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle
